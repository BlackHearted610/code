                            Hello, this is just a side note. Thank you again for reading, this really took a long time to make and this has been an awsome project that has deffinetly pushed my limits, which feel that this was so interesting to write more than 200 lines of code just for a school project .
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thank you for being so kind and encouraging, by lengthening the due date, and letting us choose the option for paper instead of just saying "Here is a paper, now write".
                            </p>
                            <p>
